Academic project made for Operating Systems classes, implementing simplified order system. Project features semaphores, paraller programming and producer-consumer problem. There are two versions of the project in two different dictionaries. One version implements synchronization between threads of a system process using <pthread> library. Another one implements synchronization between many processes using the same shared memory (<sys/shm.h> library). There are slight differences between working of two projects. For details, check README.md file in both dictionaries.
