Academic project made for Operating Systems classes, implementing simplified order system. Project features POSIX semaphores, paraller programming and producer-consumer problem. There are two versions of the project in two different folders. One version implements synchronization between threads of a system process using pthread.h library. Another one implements synchronization between many processes using the same shared memory (sys/shm.h library). There are slight differences between working of two projects. For details, check README.md file in both directories.
